## White Elephant Strategy

**To win:**
1. **Wrap it beautifully** - Mystery increases desire
2. **Keep price in the sweet spot** - $15-30 works best
3. **Balance funny with useful** - People steal practical items
4. **Avoid inside jokes** - Group-wide humor works better
5. **Food is always safe** - Everyone likes snacks

**Pro tip:** The Squatty Potty is consistently the most-stolen item at white elephants. It's funny to give, but people genuinely want it.
