## How We Choose Our Recommendations

Every product in this guide meets our strict criteria:

1. **4+ star average rating** on Amazon with at least 500 reviews
2. **Practical value** — something he'll actually use, not display
3. **Quality construction** — built to last, not break after a month
4. **Fair pricing** — worth every dollar, no gimmicks

We update this guide regularly to remove discontinued items and add new favorites based on reader feedback.

## Still Not Sure?

When in doubt, go with an experience over a thing. A nice dinner out, tickets to a game, or even just quality time together often means more than any physical gift.

But if you need something to wrap, you really can't go wrong with that YETI tumbler. Trust us.
